# Bomberman

Hello!

Welcome to my interpretation of popular game.
Simple interpretation, but with some features.

Some distinctive features:
- Own made sprites. (Player, Enemies, Bomb, Environment)
- Random generated level. Every new game happens on completely new map. 
- Random enemy generator.
- Animations for walking and dying for player and enemies.
- Friendly UI.
- Explosion animation (in progress)
- Bonus and Perks logics (in progress)
- Player customization (in progress)
- Multiplayer (in progress)
- Additional enemies (in progress)
